                                    <strong>Each member of the association works in an organized job.</strong> The work in Amuda is completely voluntary, therefore each of its people works at his job at a time that suits him and when he can, he comes to volunteer at the association. Since all members of the association feel a strong desire to be acknowledged, they often come to volunteer as much as they can.

                                    <strong>There are several explanations for this.</strong> First reason: so that the association makes sure to reach many people who see Hapoala and contribute to its maintenance. In addition: as has already been explained several times, some of the association's goals are to multiply unity once and for all, and therefore we publish as many videos and documentaries as possible to show everyone "Israel is alive" and "our strength in our unity". In addition: through advertising there are more people who need assistance and that's how they come to us, of course those who don't want advertising we don't advertise them.
